Steps
Do the following:

Open a new terminal frame in VS Code by doing the following:
Open VS Code
On the menu bar for VS Code, click "Terminal"
On the menu, click "New Terminal"
This will open a terminal frame at the bottom of the VS Code window. A terminal is a window or frame where a user can type and execute computer commands.

Copy and paste the following command into the terminal frame and execute the command by pressing the Enter key. 
This command will upgrade pip and several other parts of the Python installation modules so that pip will work correctly.

Mac OS users:
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Windows users:
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

If your computer is running the Windows operating system, and the above command doesn’t work on your computer, try the py command instead of the python command like this:
py -m pip install --user --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

Install the pytest module by copying, pasting, and executing the following command in the terminal frame.
Mac OS users:
python3 -m pip install --user pytest
Windows users:
python -m pip install --user pytest
If your computer is running the Windows operating system, and the above command doesn’t work on your computer, try the py command instead of the python command like this:
py -m pip install --user pytest
