Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

In the test_chemistry project, the power of functions allows me to make a test function to make sure that the formula or the codes
that I made are accurate and correct. Without the functions I would have to test everything one by one manually just to make sure
that the program is running and the program will produce the correct results. Also, programming without using functions would make
the whole program not easy to read and would make some things redundant.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are highly valuable. Test functions allow us to validate the correctness and the efficiency of our functions. I have
witnessed how valuable using test functions are. You can create complex formulas in your code and test if the formula is working 
using the test function.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The first thing that I do is to read the error message. Reading and understanding the error message would most likely
help you fix the problem in your codes. Then I would go into that line of code and look very carefully for the error
and fix it. Test the program again if the program shows another error, I would use the debugging method to look for the error.
One thing I can do to improve my process is to debug first the program. Debugging is a great skill that every programmer should 
know and I want to improve on that skill as well.
